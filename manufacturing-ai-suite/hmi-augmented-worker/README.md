# HMI Augmented Worker

GenAI is transforming Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) by enabling more intuitive, conversational, and context-aware interactions between operators and industrial systems. By leveraging advanced language models and retrieval-augmented generation, GenAI enhances decision-making, streamlines troubleshooting, and delivers real-time, actionable insights directly within the HMI environment. This leads to improved operator efficiency, reduced downtime, and safer manufacturing operations.

The `HMI Augmented Worker` sample application show cases how RAG pipelines can be integrated with HMI application. Besides RAG, the key feature of this sample application is that it executes in a Hypervisor based setup where HMI application executes on Windows® OS based VM while the RAG application runs in native Ubuntu or EMT based setup. This enables running this application on Intel® Core&trade; portfolio.
