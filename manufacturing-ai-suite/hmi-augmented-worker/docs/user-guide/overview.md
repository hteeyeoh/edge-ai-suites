# Overview
HMI Augmented worker is a RAG enabled HMI application deployed on Type-2 hypervisors. Deploying RAG-enabled HMI applications in a Type-2 hypervisor setup allows for flexible and efficient resource utilization by running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine.

In this architecture, the HMI application operates within a WindowsÂ® virtual machine managed by a Type-2 hypervisor such as EMT. Meanwhile, the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and supporting AI services are deployed natively on the host system, typically running EMT. This separation ensures robust isolation between the HMI and AI components, enabling independent scaling, maintenance, and updates. The setup leverages the strengths of both environments, providing a seamless integration that enhances operator experience while maintaining system reliability and security.

RAG enabled HMI applications offers a substantial opportunity to enhance the capabilities of manufacturing machine operators, especially those who are less experienced. RAG enabled LLM applications deliver a user-friendly interface for troubleshooting advice, data summarization, and planning, utilizing a knowledge base tailored to specific deployments, including telemetry data, support logs, machine manuals, and production plans. This document details the use cases, architectures, and requirements for implementing RAG LLMs in HMI systems to improve operational efficiency, decision-making, and overall productivity for machine operators.

## How it works
This section higlights the high level architecture of the sample application.

### High-Level Architecture
The system has a RAG pipeline based on Chat Question and Answer Core application alongside a typical HMI application. A knowledge base is initialized using the available documentation such as user manuals, past maintenance or support logs. When an operator detects a problem, either through direct observation or via the HMI application, they can consult the RAG pipeline for troubleshooting advice or explanations. After resolving the issue, the operator records a support log entry detailing the problem, the solution, and any relevant data. This log entry is then added to the knowledge base to aid in future troubleshooting efforts.

### Chat Question-and-Answer Core (ChatQ&A Core)

The ChatQ&A Core sample application serves as a basic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, allowing users to pose questions and obtain answers, even from their private data corpus. This sample application illustrates the construction of RAG pipelines. It is designed for minimal memory usage, being developed as a single, monolithic application with the complete RAG pipeline integrated into one microservice.

### File Watcher Service

The File Watcher Service runs alongside with HMI application on the Windows environment, consistently observing file system activities like creation, modification, and deletion. When changes are detected, it sends the pertinent file data over the network to the ChatQ&A service for ingestion and contextual processing, facilitating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. The watcher service logic is shown in the flow diagram below.

### Human Machine Interface(HMI) Application

A Human-Machine Interface(HMI) can vary depending on the use case or the creator. While HMIs generally serve as interfaces connecting users to machines, systems, or devices, their design and functionality can differ significantly based on the particular requirements of an industrial process or the preferences of the developer.
