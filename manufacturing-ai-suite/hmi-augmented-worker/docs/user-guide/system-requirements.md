# System Requirements

This page provides detailed hardware, software, and platform requirements to help you set up and run the application efficiently.

## Hardware Platforms used for validation
The `Chat question and answer Core` sample application system requirements are documented in [this](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/blob/main/sample-applications/chat-question-and-answer-core/docs/user-guide/system-requirements.md) page. The Intel® Core&trade; portfolio mentioned in this page is applicable for `HMI Augmented Worker` sample application too. The delta configurations supported is further described in this page.

The `HMI Augmented worker` sample application has been validated on Intel® Core&trade; i7-14700 based systems. The memory configuration used was 32GB which is the recommended minimum configuration. This machine hosts EMT based host together with Windows VM.
